/**
 * This sample shows how to create a Lambda function for handling Alexa Skill requests that:
 *
 * - Multiple slots: has 2 slots (BoxName and ItemName)
 * - Database Interaction: demonstrates how to read and write data to DynamoDB.
 * - Custom slot type: demonstrates using custom slot types to handle a finite set of known values
 * - LITERALslot: demonstrates how to any random text
 * - Dialog and Session state: Handles two models, both a one-shot ask and tell model, and a multi-turn dialog model.
 *   If the user provides an incorrect slot in a one-shot model, it will direct to the dialog model.
 *   See the examples section for sample interactions of these models.
 *
 * Examples:
 * Dialog model:
 *
 * One-shot model:
